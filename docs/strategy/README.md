- **$49.98:** Desktop app (unified search, organization, Network Hub)
- **$99:** Premium AI interface (BYOK, advanced features)

### The Target Market
1. **Primary:** Developers (they get "Git for AI conversations" immediately)
2. **Secondary:** Writers (preserve creative work)
3. **Tertiary:** Privacy-conscious families (digital sovereignty)

### The Launch Plan
- **Week 1:** Hacker News ("Show HN: I built Git for my AI conversations")
- **Week 2-4:** Reddit (r/LocalLLaMA, r/selfhosted, r/ChatGPT)

## Meta Note

**The Irony:** This entire planning conversation (between the user, Manus AI, Bolt.new, and Claude) is exactly the kind of valuable intellectual work that Living Nexus Archive is designed to preserve.

This conversation itself will be the first "LNA-saved conversation" once the product exists.

**Living Nexus Archive: Own your thinking. Forever.**
